Services Usage Report


Report Details

This a report on number of circulation transactions by service-point and transaction type, with time aggregated to date, day of week, and hour of day. Can also be filtered to a particular date range (either a full year or a smaller date range, as needed). This report can be used to review hourly statistics for a short time period to review staffing needs or (by aggregating to week) to report weekly statistics over a full year.

Note: the only data we have about renewals is a total count, so renewals are not included in this service desk activities report. If renewals are ever tracked with time and location information, those should be added.
