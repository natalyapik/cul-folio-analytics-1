Lost_paid_returned Report Details

This report provides a list of items that were lost and paid for by the patron, but later found and returned. 

In this query, the main filter is by the date range when the item was checked in. Also, as a hardcoded filter,  it only selects items where the status prior to checkin 
was 'lost and paid'.
