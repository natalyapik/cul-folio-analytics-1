CUL Analytics Comments
-exclude serv,remo and Borrow Direct locations
-exclude references to statistical codes
-show mode of issuance and holdings type, then compare population of both fields
-use identifier filter 'ISSN'
-need to add Government Documents indicator, which will show 
0 = is not a U.S. federal government document and 
1 = is a U.S. federal government document


QUESTIONS
-what location should be used? effective, permenant
-what is the best way to limit my results for testing purposes?
